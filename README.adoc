== Introduction

This repo contains my vim settings with a script to set them up easily on any
machine.

I'm not exactly the most experienced vim user, so don't expect anything too
fancy out of my vimrc.

== Requirements

- Git
- Vim 7.4+

== Installation

1. Clone the Repo +
`$ git clone https://github.com/pyzlnar/vim-setup.git`

2. Change directory to the repo root +
`$ cd vim-setup/`

3. Run the setup +
`$ sh setup.sh`

4. ???

5. Profit!
